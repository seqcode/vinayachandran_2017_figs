Each directory contains shell scripts to create each figure panel. For example, run Fig4/fig4a.sh to create Fig. 4A. 

Most images are automatically created. However, heatmaps must be created manually. Open a sorted CDT (see below) with TreeView (http://jtreeview.sourceforge.net/). Settings > Pixel Settings. Set global X and Y to Fill. Set zero to white. Adjust contrast as needed.
